Welcome to ExoRad 2's documentation!
=====================================

ExoRad, the generic point source radiometric model, interfaces with any instrument to provide an estimate of several Payload performance metrics.

As an example, for each target and for each photometric and spectroscopic channel, ExoRad provides estimates of:

1) Signals in pixels
2) Saturation times
3) read noise
4) photon noise
5) dark current noise
6) zodiacal bkg
7) inner sanctum
8) sky foreground

Please, report any issue or inaccuracy to the developers to support the implementation.
